        <h3>To Make Omurice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We'll make omurice one at a time. Whisk 1 egg and 1 Tbsp milk in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil in the pan over medium high heat (make sure the surface of the pan is nicely coated with oil).</li>
            <li>When the pan is hot, pour the egg mixture into the pan and tilt to cover the bottom of the pan. Lower the heat when the bottom of the egg has set (but still soft on top).</li>
            <li>Put the 3 Tbsp cheese and half of the ketchup fried rice on top of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Use the spatula to fold both sides of omelette toward the middle to cover the fried rice. Slowly move the omurice to the edge of the pan.</li>
            <li>Hold a plate in one hand and the pan in the other hand, flip the pan and move the omurice to the plate.While it’s still hot, cover the omurice with a paper towel and shape it into American /Rugby football shape. Repeat this process to make the second omurice with the rest of ingredients.</li>
